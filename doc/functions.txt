This document describes the functions from functions.h and
functions.cpp.

istream &flush_stream(istream &in)
        - flushes the inputstream given as argument by resetting the
          failure-flags and afterwards dropping the content until next
          newline
        - Problem left: if inpustream wants "int" and we give, for
          example, "2saal", then the next input gets "saal".
